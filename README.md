##### RTFEDPi is the Raspberry Pi variant of the classic ([RTFED](https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/FED_RT/tree/main)) and  is an open-source versatile tool for home-cage monitoring of behaviour and fiber photometry recording in mice. The RTFEDPi comes with 3 separate GUIs including RTFED(PiOS), RTFED(PiCAM) and RTFED(PiTTL). This system is developed as a home-cage setup to incorporate [FED3](https://github.com/KravitzLabDevices/FED3/wiki) units with TDT [RZ10](https://www.tdt.com/docs/hardware/rz10-lux-integrated-processor/) photometry processor for TTL-locked brain recording or to couple with USB cameras to capture event-triggered videos of behaviour.



# ‚ùì What are GUIs of RTFEDPi?
## üê≠üßÄRTFED(PiOS)
##### RTFED(PiOS) can be used to remotely monitor feeding behaviour and other interactions made by mice on FED3, the data is automatically transferred to a Google spreadsheet where you can view it or define alarm notification using the Google Apps Scripts. Using the RTFEDPiOS you can also change the Mode of your FED3s without the hassle of poking one by one, or synchronize time on all FED3 units! 
***However, if you are just aiming for monitoring feeding behaviour, we recommend using the basic([RTFED](https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/FED_RT/tree/main)) on Windows, as it is more efficient just to use your Windows computers/laptops instead of setting up a Raspberry Pi.***

## üìΩÔ∏èüê≠üßÄRTFED(PiCAM)
##### RTFED(PiCAM) is an additional feature to the basic RTFED where you can enhance your behavioural studies by having event-triggered video recording. Primarily the RTFED(PiCAM) can record videos of mice using common USB cameras after taking Pellets, making Left or Right pokes or a combination of All of these events. Videos are limited to 30 sec length to capture only relevant behaviours while saving storage space, in this configuration, e.g. after collecting a pellet, the GUI records the behaviour for 30 sec, if another pellet is taken within this 30 sec, it keeps recording for an extra 30 sec until no more pellet is taken.

## üö®üê≠üßÄRTFED(PiTTL)
##### The TTL station of RTFED logs behavioural events made on FED3 devices and transmit them to the TDT RZ10 processors as TTL pulses. This feature enables you to study event-locked signals in your experiments. However the PiTTL version does not send data online to reduce any processing load that might delay the rapid TTL puls transmission. The PiTTL also stores the behavioural session data in structured folders and provides a summary of behavioural events at the end of the recording session.

*PiTTL relays the behavioural events to the photometry system, in this example, a surge of dopamine in the Nucleus accumbens is observed at the moment of pellet retrieval.*

# üöÄHow to use RTFED on a Raspberry Pi?
#### 0Ô∏è‚É£Initial setups:
##### To use the GUIs included on the RTFEDPi, first you need to follow most of the instructions explained on our main repository ([RTFED](https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/FED_RT/tree/main)), that includes updating your FED3 devices with RTFED library;  if you need to use the PiCAM system or the Basic RTFED, you will need to also follow the instructions to make a Google project and the other settings on a Google spreadsheet, otherwise, to use the PiTTL system, you only need to update your FED3 firmware with RTFED library.

##### Purchase the rest of the items needed in your experiment, e.g. usb camera, long USB cables, USB hub, DB25 cables, etc.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get a Raspberry Pi
##### As noted on our [shopping list](https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/FED_RT/blob/RTFEDPi/source/RTFED_SHOPPING_LIST.pdf), we used a Raspberry Pi 4 B model (4GB RAM version), and we recommend using the similar model since we have tested the system on this particular model. You can visit the Raspberrypi ([webpage](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)) to choose your location and online supplier to order the board.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Quick route
##### You can use this IMAGE file (üößüößüößUnder construction üößüößüöß ) to flash your Raspberry Pi's microSD card, this way, you will have exactly the same folders and files that we used in our validation experiments. After connecting your Pi to a monitor, you will find 3 folders named RTFED(PiTTL, PiCAM and PiOS), inside each folder you will find a subfolder named /dist and there you can run the executable file to access the GUIs. 

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Advanced route
##### Alternatively, you can build your own Raspberry Pi from the scratch, follow the instructions on Raspberry Pi ([webpage](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)) to install the Raspberry Pi OS. Now you can structure your Raspberry Pi as you wish.

***Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi,***
*create a new environment on your raspberry pi using this command*
                    
                    python3 -m venv RTFEDPi
*then activate this env using the command below*
                    
                    source RTFEDPi/bin/activate

*Now your shell should be "inside" the new environment, e.g. like this:*
                        
                    (RTFEDPi) pi@raspberrypi:~ $

*Download [RTFEDPi.txt](https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/FED_RT/tree/RTFEDPi/source/ENV_FILES/RTFEDPi.txt) and place it in the current directory (you will probably be in your HOME directory)*

*Run the command below to install all the necessary packages in your newly created environment*

                    pip install -r RTFEDPi.txt

*Now you can either copy the .py files of RTFEDPiOS, RTFEDPiCAM and RTFEDPiTTL from this [directory](https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/FED_RT/tree/RTFEDPi/scripts), paste them in a proper location on your Raspberry Pi and use the command below, to reach your desired GUI, e.g. for the PiTTL GUI you can use:*

                     python RTFEDPiTTL.py
*Please note that you must run that command in the directory where the file is located*

* Alternatively, you can run jupyter lab from your terminal in case you are interested in making changes to the codes using the .ipynb files from the same [directory](https://github.com/mccutcheonlab/FED_RT/tree/RTFEDPi/scripts)
